## Inspiration
SolFit was inspired by the growing importance of mental health and wellness in today's fast-paced world. We noticed that many people struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle and wanted to create an app that would incentivize them to prioritize their fitness and wellness goals.

## What it does
SolFit is a reward app that encourages users to lead a healthy lifestyle by offering cryptocurrency rewards for meeting fitness and wellness goals. The app features a daily mental health survey built using the SurveyKit library, and users are rewarded with Solana micro-rewards after each completion. The app interacts with the Solana network using the Solana Mobile Stack SDK.

<!-- ## How we built it
We started by researching various reward and cryptocurrency systems to find the best fit for our app. We chose Solana as our reward currency due to its speed, scalability, and low transaction fees. We then used the SurveyKit library to build a daily mental health survey, and integrated the Solana Mobile Stack SDK to handle transactions and network interaction.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating the Solana network into our app. We had to spend a lot of time learning about the Solana ecosystem and the Solana Mobile Stack SDK to ensure that we could properly handle transactions and network interaction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the fact that we were able to create a functional app that incentivizes users to prioritize their fitness and wellness goals. We believe that our app can have a positive impact on people's lives and help them lead healthier and happier lives.

## What we learned
Through building SolFit, we learned about the importance of mental health and the role that technology can play in promoting it. We also learned about the Solana network and how it can be used to reward users for completing various tasks and activities.

## What's next for SolFit?
We plan to continue refining and improving SolFit by adding new features, such as support for additional cryptocurrencies, gamification elements, and integration with wearable fitness devices. We also plan to expand our user base by marketing SolFit to health and wellness communities and promoting it through various channels. -->
